# Platform Primitives: Inbox, Outbox, Fanout, and Fan-In

This overview connects the platform's messaging primitives end-to-end. It explains how inbox and outbox tables participate in claim/ack/abandon semantics, how fanout builds on them to distribute work, and how fan-in (joins) consolidate results. Use this as a mental map before diving into API or schema reference pages.

## Core Roles at a Glance
- **Outbox**: Reliable, retryable publisher that turns transactional writes into background work. Implements claim → handler → ack/abandon/fail with automatic lease expiry.
- **Inbox**: Idempotent consumer guard that records messages already processed. Uses the same claim/ack/abandon lifecycle to protect handler execution.
- **Fanout**: Distributes outbox messages to multiple destinations or tenants while preserving the same leases and retries.
- **Fan-In (Join)**: Waits for multiple outbox messages to finish, then triggers a follow-up action once the group completes.

## Database Tables

### Outbox and Inbox Work Queues
- `Outbox`: Stores outbound messages with work-queue columns (`Status`, `LockedUntil`, `OwnerToken`, retry counts) plus payload metadata (`Topic`, `Payload`, correlation/causation IDs, timestamps).
- `Inbox`: Stores inbound message receipts with identical work-queue columns plus source identifiers (`MessageId`, `Source`, optional content hash) to guarantee at-most-once processing.
- Stored procedures for both queues follow the same shape: `Claim`, `Ack`, `Abandon`, `Fail`, and `ReapExpired` (lease expiry recovery).

### Fanout Metadata
- `FanoutPolicy`: Defines routing rules (topics to downstream destinations or tenant scopes).
- `FanoutCursor`: Tracks per-policy progress so handlers resume from the last dispatched outbox message after restarts.

### Fan-In (Join) Tables
- `OutboxJoin`: Declares a group of related outbox messages and tracks completion/failed counts.
- `OutboxJoinMember`: Associates individual outbox messages with a join so completion reporting happens automatically inside `Outbox_Ack`/`Outbox_Fail`.

## Claim/Ack/Abandon/Lease Expiry Across Components
1. **Claim**: Workers call `*_Claim` (outbox or inbox) to atomically move items from `Ready` to `InProgress`, set `OwnerToken`, and apply a lease by setting `LockedUntil = now + leaseSeconds`.
2. **Handler Execution**: While the lease is active, the worker dispatches to the appropriate handler(s) and downstream actions (fanout) or dedupes inbound work (inbox).
3. **Acknowledge**: On success, `*_Ack` clears the lease, marks the row as `Done`, and — for fan-in — updates `OutboxJoin` counters for any attached members.
4. **Abandon / Retry**: Temporary failures call `*_Abandon`, returning the item to `Ready` so another worker can claim it after backoff.
5. **Lease Expiry**: If a worker crashes, `*_ReapExpired` resets `InProgress` rows whose `LockedUntil` is in the past, making them claimable again.
6. **Permanent Failures**: `*_Fail` marks the item as failed and records diagnostics; fan-in joins receive failure counts from this path.

The same lifecycle underpins fanout and fan-in: fanout dispatchers claim outbox messages with leases; fan-in waits are themselves outbox messages that claim and ack like any other handler-controlled work item.

## Sequence: Fanout to Fan-In

    participant App as App Transaction
    participant Outbox as Outbox Table
    participant Fanout as Fanout Worker
    participant Handler as Topic Handlers
    participant Join as Fan-In (join.wait)
    participant Followup as Follow-up Topic

    App->>Outbox: Enqueue message (transaction commit)
    Fanout->>Outbox: Claim batch (sets OwnerToken + LockedUntil)
    Outbox-->>Fanout: Claimed message
    Fanout->>Handler: Dispatch while lease is active
    Handler-->>Fanout: Work completes
    Fanout->>Outbox: Ack (updates joins via Outbox_Ack)
    Outbox-->>Join: Join counters advance (CompletedSteps/FailedSteps)
    Join->>Outbox: Claim join.wait message when steps finished
    Join->>Followup: Enqueue onComplete/onFail topic
    Join->>Outbox: Ack join.wait
    Note over Outbox: If lease expires at any point, ReapExpired returns the row to Ready
```

## Sequence: Multi-Tenant Fanout Routing

    Producer->>Router: GetOutbox(tenantId)
    Router->>TenantDB: Enqueue message in tenant-specific Outbox
    loop Background polling
        Selector->>Dispatcher: Next tenant store (round-robin/drain-first)
        Dispatcher->>TenantDB: Claim messages (lease)
        TenantDB-->>Dispatcher: Claimed batch
        Dispatcher->>Handler: Invoke handler per Topic
        Handler-->>Dispatcher: Ack/Abandon/Fail decision
        Dispatcher->>TenantDB: Ack or Abandon; ReapExpired handles crashes
    end

## When to Use Each Primitive
- **Use the Outbox** when you need reliable, retryable publication of domain events or commands.
- **Use the Inbox** when consuming external events that might be delivered multiple times.
- **Add Fanout** when a single outbox stream must drive multiple destinations or tenants; policies and cursors keep routing deterministic and resumable.
- **Add Fan-In** when downstream steps must wait for a group of outbox messages to finish before continuing.
