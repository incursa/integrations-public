## Key Features

### Pluggable Architecture
```csharp
// Round-robin for fair distribution
services.AddMultiSqlOutbox(outboxOptions, new RoundRobinOutboxSelectionStrategy());

// Drain-first for priority processing
services.AddMultiSqlOutbox(outboxOptions, new DrainFirstOutboxSelectionStrategy());

// Custom strategy
services.AddMultiSqlOutbox(outboxOptions, new MyCustomStrategy());
```

### Static Configuration
```csharp
var outboxOptions = new[]
{
    new SqlOutboxOptions { ConnectionString = "...;Database=Customer1;..." },
    new SqlOutboxOptions { ConnectionString = "...;Database=Customer2;..." },
    new SqlOutboxOptions { ConnectionString = "...;Database=Customer3;..." },
};

services.AddMultiSqlOutbox(outboxOptions);
```

### Dynamic Discovery
```csharp
services.AddMultiSqlOutbox(
    provider => new DynamicOutboxStoreProvider(
        provider.GetRequiredService<IDatabaseRegistry>(),
        provider.GetRequiredService<TimeProvider>(),
        provider.GetRequiredService<ILoggerFactory>()));
```

### Backward Compatibility
```csharp
// Single outbox - unchanged, fully compatible
services.AddSqlOutbox(new SqlOutboxOptions
{
    ConnectionString = "...",
    SchemaName = "infra",
    TableName = "Outbox",
});
```

## How to Apply to Other Primitives

The `docs/multi-database-pattern.md` file provides a **complete blueprint** for applying this pattern to inbox and distributed locks:

### For Inbox (Step-by-Step Guide Included)

1. Create `IInboxWorkStoreProvider` interface
2. Create `IInboxSelectionStrategy` interface
3. Implement `RoundRobinInboxSelectionStrategy` and `DrainFirstInboxSelectionStrategy`
4. Create `MultiInboxDispatcher` class
5. Create `MultiInboxPollingService` class
6. Add `AddMultiSqlInbox()` extension methods

**Code templates and examples are provided in the documentation.**

### For System Leases (Guidance Included)

Since leases are acquired on-demand rather than polled:

1. Create `ISystemLeaseFactoryProvider` interface (no selection strategy needed)
2. Implement provider for managing lease factories across databases
3. Create helper methods for acquiring leases across multiple databases

**Code examples and use cases are provided in the documentation.**

## Usage Example (From Problem Statement)

The implementation directly addresses the requirements from the problem statement:

> "Pretend I've got five customers and each customer has their own database. Each customer database has its own outbox with all of the stored procedures and things that we have today. Well, I need to have a single handler which deals with a particular kind of event. Maybe it's a send email event."

```csharp
// Configure outboxes for 5 customer databases
var customerOutboxes = new[]
{
    new SqlOutboxOptions { ConnectionString = "...;Database=Customer1DB;..." },
    new SqlOutboxOptions { ConnectionString = "...;Database=Customer2DB;..." },
    new SqlOutboxOptions { ConnectionString = "...;Database=Customer3DB;..." },
    new SqlOutboxOptions { ConnectionString = "...;Database=Customer4DB;..." },
    new SqlOutboxOptions { ConnectionString = "...;Database=Customer5DB;..." },
};

// Register multi-outbox with round-robin strategy
services.AddMultiSqlOutbox(
    customerOutboxes,
    selectionStrategy: new RoundRobinOutboxSelectionStrategy());

// Register a single handler for all databases
services.AddOutboxHandler<SendEmailHandler>();
```

The system will:
- ✅ Enumerate through all customer databases
- ✅ Claim items from each database
- ✅ Execute the handler for each message
- ✅ Reschedule failed items with backoff
- ✅ Mark successfully processed items as dispatched
- ✅ Round-robin through databases for fair distribution

## Quality Metrics

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Apply to Inbox**: Follow the pattern guide in `docs/multi-database-pattern.md`
2. **Apply to System Leases**: Use the guidance provided for on-demand lease acquisition
3. **Custom Strategies**: Implement priority-based or SLA-based selection strategies
4. **Monitoring**: Add per-database metrics and health checks
5. **Dynamic Discovery**: Implement database registry with automatic refresh

All the tools, patterns, and documentation are now in place to extend this functionality to other platform primitives.
